## üìñ The Story

*"A Dog Once Named Tito"* is an immersive VR journey that lets players experience life as Tito, a once-beloved dog now lost in a harsh urban environment.  

The story follows Tito as he:  
- Waits endlessly for his owner, who never returns.  
- Ventures into the city, encountering **loneliness, hunger, and danger**.  
- Visits a **park**, a **fast-food restaurant**, and **busy streets**, where NPCs react with hostility.  
- Meets **other dogs**, both threatening and territorial.  
- Faces survival challenges such as **traffic hazards** and unpredictable human behavior.  

Tito‚Äôs journey culminates at a **bus stop**, where he collapses from exhaustion. Just when hope seems lost, a kind woman rescues him, promising a new home ‚Äî bringing the experience to a heartfelt conclusion.

## ‚ú® Features

### Text-Based UI in Hand
- UI displayed on the **right-hand remote**.  
- Provides story context and control information, updating as the journey unfolds.  

### Scent-Based Navigation
- Players follow **scent trails**, visualized in the environment.  
- Unlocks new story updates on the hand UI when scents are discovered.  

### NPC Interaction Systems
- **Angry NPCs**: Shout, shush, or chase the player when provoked or approached.  
- **Traffic System**: Cars move **unpredictably**, acting as hazards even near sidewalks.  
  - This chaotic movement is intentional ‚Äî it simulates the **dog‚Äôs lack of understanding** of traffic rules and human order.  
  - From Tito‚Äôs perspective, cars seem erratic and dangerous because he cannot predict their behavior.  
- **Dog NPCs**: Territorial dogs bark and act aggressively when the player enters their space.
- **Bird NPCs**: Birds make loud noises and react to Tito‚Äôs presence by **flying away in multiple directions**, adding to the dynamic and immersive environment.  
- **Adopter NPC**: A kind human at the end who rescues Tito.  

### Threatening World
- Objects are **scaled dynamically upwards**, making the world feel intimidating from Tito‚Äôs perspective. How much an object is scaled up is calculated based on how much taller than the player the
object originally was. Objects smaller than the player or with similar height remain the same but tall buildings and street lights tower above the dog, reinforcing vulnerability.  

### Day & Night Cycle
- A **moving sun and moon** cycle creates a passage of time.  
- **Nighttime brings dread**, while **sunrise offers hope**.  

### Object Interaction
- Players can pick up food and small objects (like a **Hot Dog**) with the **primary trigger button**.  
- Carry it to Tito‚Äôs mouth slot and eat it with the **A button**.
